Owner's manual
================================================================================

Congratulations on your purchase of a brand new self-driving car! This
convenient guide will tell you everything you need to know about operating your
luxurious new vehicle.


⚽ Playing a game
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This bot is part of the RLBot bot pack. The easiest way to get a copy is to open
the RLBot GUI and download the bot pack from there. Then drag "Self-Driving Car"
onto a team and click Play!

If you're using a different match runner, as long as it is compatible with RLBot
config files, you can use the config named `self-driving-car.cfg` inside the
`self-driving-car` directory.


🔨 Testing the bot
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run a minimal self-test of the bot, you will need RLBot and Rocket League
installed. Start Rocket League. Then open a command prompt in this directory
(the directory with `rlbot.cfg`) and run this command:

    python -c "from rlbot import runner; runner.main()"

That will start a 1v1 between this bot and a Psyonix All-Star.


📞 Contacting the manufacturer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For any questions or concerns, feel free to get in touch the factory. We love
hearing from our loyal customers! We can be reached Monday through Friday,
8am–5pm, at whatisaphone#8521 in the RLBot discord.
